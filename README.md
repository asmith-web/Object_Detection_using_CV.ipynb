Object Detection locates objects in an image and labels them with a class + confidence. It's broader than classification because detection retruns where each object is.

Why YOLOv8?
YOLOv8 is a modern, easy-to-use implementation of YOLO family with a simple Python API for inference & training. Excellent for teaching quick demos and moving to custom datasets.

Real-World Examples
* Autonomous vehicles: detect pedestrians, cars, traffic signals.
* Retail: shelf monitoring, automated checkout.
* Industrial inspection: detect defective parts on a conveyor.
* Security: detect intruders, suspicious objects in CCTV feeds.
